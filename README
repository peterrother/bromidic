bromidic is a no-frills static blog engine that uses the textile markup language
(with Jason Samsa's python-textile generator). It was intended for my own blog
but I've opened it up a bit so anyone can use.

You'll have to configure two lines in blog/config.py before running 'make' in the
root dir.

I've included a few scripts for easily creating new blog posts. You'll find them
in the root dir.

More to come when I have time.
